# Application-For-Ticket-Booking-Management

A group project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject "Worldwide Web". </br> </br>
The program was written in the Eclipse development environment, in the language 
Java programming language. The 3-tier architecture was implemented, with application 
server Tomcat and with MySQL as the database management system. 
The design of the diagram and creation of the database that 
used in the program was done through the MySQL Workbench.  </b></br> </br> 

<b>Specifically your application will support the following functions: </b></br> </br> 

•	Login to the application based on username as admin, contentadmin or customer with different possibilities for each one. </br> </br>
•	As an administrator the list of registered users and a menu with the options to make an application administrator registration, add a content manager, delete a content manager, add a customer, update user information and search for a user is displayed on the main page. </br> </br>
• As a content manager you are presented on the main page the list of available movies and a menu with the options to add a movie and delete a movie. </br> </br>
• Αs a customer you are presented on the main page the list of available films and a menu with the options to view the program with the available films, the possibility of booking tickets and the history of reservations. </br> </br>

<b>Ιnstallation Ιnstructions:</b> </br> </br>

• First the user will need to download Eclipse which is mainly an integrated software development environment (IDE) used for application development. </br> </br>
• Then through the directory the project is found in the location where it is installed. </br> </br> 
• It is also necessary for the functionality of the project to install a mysql-connector that provides a driver for connecting applications to MySQL databases. This driver allows applications to communicate and exchange data with MySQL to perform SQL commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Which you add to the libraries of the Java Build Path of the project. </br> </br> As seen in the screenshot below: </br> </br>
